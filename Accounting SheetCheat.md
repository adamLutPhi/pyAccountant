# Introduction
We, as humans, living in a society, 
 have needs, they are possibly
fullfilled by paying for it , 
the payment usually in a local currency, of a country, 
Any marketable item in the market has a price, usually stated and offered, in an exchange for a price

(As nothing is for free, except the air that we breath

The Air, fortunately, is not as scarce as other items in the market.
Another scarce item is water. It is not as free,  its price is stated and payed for by a `customer`

Any transacion involves 2 parties : 

1. the `Payer`
2. the `Payee`

The `Payer` can pay for items purchased, via payment methods. Popular payment forms involve:
1. Cash 
2. Debit Card
3. Credit Card 

Likewise, any business has an owner, or a `proprietor`
To run a business, a few temporary workers, ro employees, are required.
Employees work in a job,  regularly for some time, in an exchange of some value, 

In addition, They are reward for the value offered in the following possible ways: 
1. Hourly
2. Bi-weekly
3. Monthly

Let's say we happen to be in a cafe, at a popular coffee joint: the items involved are stated by the company for persons  involved
Let it be the expense made for coffee,  or a glass of water in a restaurant.

# Accounting Equation 
any exchange of value is called a `transaction` it involves (2) parteries

A `transaction` is required to be registered, and stored. It has been stored in such a way that is made to be `fool-proofed`, so that any transaction can be verified
without bias exerted by individuals.

Instead of writing : "today I have made a payment"
It is necessary to mention the form of payment (`Cash`, `Debit`, `Credit`) 
so if I paid $20 : I can write it down in  brand sheet of paper as follows:
	Proprietor Name
Date(today) $ 10
Yet, this form is prone to error. Accounting solves these issues by requiring parties involed to write the transaction, in their books
soi.e. paying $10 in starbucks by cash:

	Proprietor Name
Date(today)  cash     $ 10
		
As we have used `cash` from our pocket 

Date(today)  Dr cash     $ 10

`Dr cash     $ 10` means we have made a purchased with `cash`, and Lost  $ 10 in Cash

*But what did we buy, again?* this Transaction still lacks the `Object` which is **`coffee`**:

`Date(today)  Dr  cash   $ 10  Cr Coffee $ 10 `

`Cr Coffee 10`:  means that, we **we currently have the actual coffee** got coffee worth of $10, as of result . it can be in the car , inyou could have entirely drank it, or left it in the fridge, it doesn't matter, as much as you've got in your `inventory` that's a  $ `Cr Coffee $ 10`
`inventory` could be any place of storage: where item lives at the moment (of transaction (a `fridge`, in our case)

As coffee has value, we somehow intuitively care about it, so that we have stored it ( so we could enjoy it)

Say we had it over lucnch, and finished it: **MONEY WAS NOT INVOLVED in the process of having that _cup of coffee_**
(while stock exchange has moved (maybe drastically); we're not observing the `stock exchange`, `EUR/USD` on the `forex exchange`
We didn't lose more money, nor have we gained more money ... it is **`Ceteris Paribus`**, as nothing else has changed.


This transaction has defenitely made us better off: we felt the buzz of coffee in our hear, we felt good, but

Each transaction makes us better off, than before... (- if we are spending money, *wisely enough*)

Remember: feelings stay away from accounting entries, as we are ratrional beings.
		
At the money of purchase: stabucks also makes  fool-proof transaction, :

# Starbucks

`Dr Coffee $10`: we have freed $10 `retail-price` worth of coffee:
The plastic cup, the beans involved, the sticker... allof those, they are `supplies`  already handeled, at the time of purchase, last month.

- how about the work?
- hmm, in `Managerial Accounting`: it is accounted for, on its own , in a different book... it's called `wages` 
(our company deals with it , bi-weekly it's a contract with the `staff` we recruit ).


`Cr Cash $10`
We've got cash, we write about cash, it is a form of money, and we are responsible to write it down, in our accounts.
Why: well, we're `$10` richer 

_Wait_, how about that **Pen**, we used to  write funny customer faces on `:)` ?
Ah, you mean  `stationary` : that pen is already accounted for in our database, long before today, since the day it was born: `The purchase Date` (so, don't worry about it, that much).


`DebitAccounts = CreditAccounts`

An acconting rule: The `Left Hand` side must be equal to the `Right Hand`:

`Assets =  Liabilities + Capital `

`Assets` Equal to `capital` (i.e. bank accounts), `Liabilities` (sum owed to sa third-party )


# Accounting reports types 

1.  `Balance Sheet`: most important report , with it we (accountant)  can verify & Test  accounting is balanced (& correct)

2. `Statement of Comprehensive Income` (SOCI ) { or `Income Statement` }

3.  `Statement of Cashflows` (Cash Flow statement) 
1. `Balance Sheet`
contains 

## Assets 

which has mainly `two (2)` parts:

1. `Current Assets` 
2. `Non-Current Assets`

# Records 

value is flow-oriented, can be either an :

1. `In-flow` of Income
2. `Out-flow` of expenditures 

#Reason: to Report it (to stakeholders: proprietor(s), taxation entity )

# Accounting Objects: 

## Accounting Formula     

Asset =  Liability + Capital[Cr] [: + Revenue[Cr] - Expenditure[Dr] ]

 **Note**: Expenditure is always negative, hence it's the opposite of a Credit ( a Debit)

 - **acts the same way as an Expense**
     
` DebitAccount = CreditAccount` 

# DebitAccounts 

## Assets 

### cash (BarnettInn)         
 paid in-full

## Expenses 
### AccountsReceivable [A/R] 
A Debtors' account (for entites the owe us) for the current time perion (a year, or less).
where payment (to be recieved later )
