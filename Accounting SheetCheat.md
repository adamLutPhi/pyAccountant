# Introduction
We, as humans, living in a society, 
 have needs, they are possibly
fullfilled by paying for it , 
the payment usually in a local currency, of a country, 
Any marketable item in the market has a price, usually stated and offered, in an exchange for a price

(As nothing is for free, except the air that we breath

The Air, fortunately, is not as scarce as other items in the market.
Another scarce item is water. It is not as free,  its price is stated and payed for by a `customer`

Any transacion involves 2 parties : 

1. the `Payer`
2. the `Payee`

The `Payer` can pay for items purchased  in may payments

Likewise, any business has an owner, or a `proprietor`
To run a business, a few temporary workers, or employees, are required.
Employees work in a job, in an exchange of some value

In addition, They are reward for the value offered in many possible ways: 
1. Hourly
2. Bi-weekly
3. Monthly

Let's say we happen to be in a cafe, at a popular coffee joint , the items involved are stated by the company for persons  involved
Let it be the expense made for coffee,  or a glass of water in a restaurant.

# Accounting Equation 
Any transaction is required to be registered , and stored. It has been stored  in such a way that is made to be fool-proofed, without any bias exerted by individuals

`DebitAccounts = CreditAccounts`

An acconting rule: The `Left Hand` side must be equal to the `Right Hand`:

`Assets =  Liabilities + Capital `

`Assets` Equal to `capital` (i.e. bank accounts), `Liabilities` (sum owed to sa third-party )


# Accounting reports types 

1.  `Balance Sheet`: most important report , with it we (accountant)  can verify & Test  accounting is balanced (& correct)

2. `Statement of Comprehensive Income` (SOCI ) { or `Income Statement` }

## Assets

2. `Out-flow` of expenditures

## Accounting Formula     

Asset =  Liability + Capital[Cr] [: + Revenue[Cr] - Expenditure[Dr] ]

 **Note**: Expenditure is always negative, hence it's the opposite of a Credit ( a Debit)

 - **acts the same way as an Expense**
     
` DebitAccount = CreditAccount`
